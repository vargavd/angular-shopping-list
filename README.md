# Shopping list for learning Angular

This project is a learning tool for me to revive my Angular knowledge, as well as for making a shopping webapp for myself, for helping with my recurring online shoppings.

## Features (in progress)
  - Two distinct shopping list - one for the "next" shopping, and one where every item ever bought is stored
  - You can "reset" the current shopping list - it will create another shopping storing the date and items that were on the current list
  - Shopping list - list the shoppings with date as openable panels - you can see which items were bought at every shopping


## Used in this project:
  - Angular 11.1.2
  - Bootstrap 4.6
  - Font Awesome 4.7
  - Courage :)


## How to run it
Clone or download this repository and run *npm install*, then *ng serve -o*. It will generate the app and open it in your default browser. You will also need [Angular installed](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli) on your system.
